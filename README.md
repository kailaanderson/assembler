# assembler
Assembler project

This program reads a given infix expression from a file and converts it to postfix. It then uses the postfix expression to write out the sequence of assembly instructions to another file.
This demonstrates the use of the stack ADT, string ADT, linked lists, and stack algorithms.

Running the program:
- typing "make test" in command line builds and runs all tests
- "postfix input [output]" where the input file name is required and the output file name is optional.
- use "make postfix" to build the application
- "make assembler" runs the assembly application
